synopsis: Priority Search Queue
description: A /priority search queue/ efficiently supports the
             opperations of both a search tree and a priority queue. A
             'Binding' is a product of a key and a priority.  Bindings
             can be inserted, deleted, modified and queried in
             logarithmic time, and the binding with the least priority
             can be retrieved in constant time.  A queue can be built
             from a list of bindings, sorted by keys, in linear time.
